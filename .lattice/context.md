<!-- Every lattice instance exists for a reason — a convergence of intention
     and infrastructure. This file declares that reason. Agents and humans
     read it to understand the purpose, conventions, and relationships
     of this particular node in the lattice. -->

## Purpose

<!-- What does this instance observe? What project, team, or domain
     does it serve? Declare the scope of attention. -->

## Related Instances

<!-- If this node coordinates with other lattice instances, name them here.
     Include instance_id, instance_name, and the nature of the relationship.
     The lattice is stronger when its nodes are aware of each other. -->

## Conventions

<!-- Every instance develops its own rhythms — workflow conventions,
     naming patterns, status meanings that diverge from defaults.
     Record them here so that new minds arriving in this context
     can orient immediately. -->
