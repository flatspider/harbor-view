(2) HarborScene zoom range: lerp(0.6, 2.8, pow(zoomProgress, 0.65)) \u2014 exact match. (3) Lerp smoothing factor: 0.18 \u2192 0.35 \u2014 exact match. (4) Hit sphere radius formula updated in both locations (lines 250 and 302) to Math.max(8, Math.min(40, lengthM * WORLD_UNITS_PER_METER * 1.05 : 14)) \u2014 both identical and matching plan. (5) Wake floor removed: wakeScaleBase = markerData.sizeScale with no Math.max wrapper \u2014 exact match. TypeScript type check (npx tsc --noEmit) passed with zero errors. No unrelated changes in the diff. Implementation is a clean, focused change across 5 locations in 2 files, exactly as scoped.
