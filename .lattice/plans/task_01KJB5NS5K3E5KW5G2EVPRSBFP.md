# HAR-52: Roadmap: Ghibli transformation mode and radar loading screen

## Scope
Update the 12-month roadmap to include an ambitious, concrete initiative for a Studio Ghibli-style transformation mode and a radar/sonar loading-screen experience.

## Steps
1. Add roadmap items that define Ghibli mode as a replay-adjacent cinematic toggle with ripple/sunrise transformation and ship sprite restyling.
2. Add roadmap items that define a radar button and sonar-sweep loading screen integrated with polygon/boat loading states.
3. Place these in Q1 deliverables with measurable milestones while preserving existing roadmap structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- ROADMAP.md explicitly includes Studio Ghibli mode goals, animation behavior, and ship transformation behavior.
- ROADMAP.md explicitly includes radar screen mode and loading-screen role tied to map/ship asset loading.
- Changes remain in ROADMAP.md only.
