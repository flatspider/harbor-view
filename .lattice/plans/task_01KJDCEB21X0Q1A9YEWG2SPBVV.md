# HAR-77: Hide 3D hulls under ship sprites

Fade out or disable the underlying 3D hull and detail meshes for vessel markers so that the new category-specific sprite imagery and wakes are the primary visible representation of each ship, preserving interaction hit areas and wakes while removing the visual clutter of overlapping geometry.
